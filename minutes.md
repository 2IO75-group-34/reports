# Minutes of Meetings

Maintained by: Amir Nurmukhambetov (1930907)

## First Meeting

We chatted with neigbouiring group 33. We decided to work with for now but the whole group hasn't yet decided.

We created a github repository for managing all documents, like decision list, minutes, and logbooks. And added all team members.

We started to brainstorm ideas:

**ideas:**

- [ ] **NFC tagged baggage**. Where NFC indicates where the baggage should go. Similar to how baggage is transported do different planes.
- [ ] **Weight sorting**. Customized baggage with different weight distrubtion, based on it sort them.
- [ ] **Main brain system**. A system which dictates other sub-subsystems adjacent to it.
- [ ] **Morse code ouput**. A robot that outputs baggage in a way to display morse code.
- [ ] **Rotating table of baskets**.
- [ ] **Water convayerbelt**. Have boats that transport baggages.
- [ ] **Binary Addition**. Inputting in a black/white baggages in coresponding way outputs a result of addition in binary.
- [ ] **Lost & Found Storage**. Sort baggages in some way and using vertical space as storage (done via elevator)
- [ ] **Carwash**. A robot sorts baggage into clean and dirty. Then all dirty baggages are getting cleaned like a carwash.
- [ ] **Platics warpper**. From NFC those baggages that are type wrap are wrapped and then sorted somewhere else.

**Possible cool features that can be implemented:**

- Screen display feature, to show users any addition
- Using NFC we can store more detailed information about the baggage.
- Elevator, Catapult, Zipline.

Scrum master were decided:
